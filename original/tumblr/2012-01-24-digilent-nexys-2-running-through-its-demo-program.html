I completed a VHDLÂ <a href="http://www.echelonembedded.com/fpgaresources/">tutorial</a> last night that displayed the hexadecimal version of the first four switches acting as bits. The Digilent Linux tools aren&rsquo;t so great, at least compared to the screenshots of the Windows tools, but they do work after a little prodding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd that Digilent would consider their USB firmware proprietary, leading to a lot of <a href="http://www.hackdaworld.org/cgi-bin/awki.cgi/NexysFPGA">inefficient</a> <a href="http://www.sensicomm.com/main/projects/fpga/digilent_nexys_usb.shtml">effort</a> on the part of various <a href="http://braiden.org/?p=59">Linux</a> <a href="http://ixo-jtag.sourceforge.net/nexys2-linux-howto.html">hackers</a> to reverse-engineer it. What exactly is Digilent protecting? It&rsquo;s a bootloader for a $150 low-end design tool, big deal. Someone should build an FPGA board like this with an ATmega32u4 as the USB frontend. It&rsquo;ll look like an Arduino Leonardo to the PC, but it&rsquo;ll have super powers.</p>
