<p>Sometimes I come across interesting things to download while I&rsquo;m out and about, but I can&rsquo;t download them (because I&rsquo;m on a phone) or I&rsquo;m at work (where I&rsquo;d then have to figure out how to transfer them to home). These are things that are wasteful to sic Dropbox on.</p>
<p>What I really want is to have a private email address I can email URLs, and whoever&rsquo;s listening on the other end will cause my home file server to download the content (handling properly if the resource turns out to be a torrent).</p>
<p>Does such a thing exist?</p>
