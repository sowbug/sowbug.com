<p>There are eight new <a href="/post/133445471621/weblight">WebLights</a> in the world as of today!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4160" data-orig-width="3120"><img src="http://66.media.tumblr.com/488e05ad2656d50b975e54b41afa1fd5/tumblr_inline_nyyracZqQy1qjj3vh_540.jpg" data-orig-height="4160" data-orig-width="3120"/></figure><p>I did a short run of 10 PCBs (version <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/weblight/tree/master/hardware/mfg/developer/a-seeed1">a-seeed1</a>) from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/">SeeedStudio</a>, placing the order November 10 and receiving it December 3. I decided to try making a solder stencil with my new <a href="http://amzn.to/1TuFv8y">Silhouette Cameo</a> according to the <a href="http://www.idleloop.com/robotics/cutter/index.php#stencil">excellent instructions from Cathy Saxton</a>.<br/></p><p>I used <a href="http://amzn.to/1TuF8uI">4 mil mylar</a> for the stencil material. This required a blade depth of 3 rather than the 1 that Cathy recommended. It’s possible that 2 would work, but I didn’t notice any scoring on the mat.</p><p>My stencil shapes didn’t turn out perfectly square; instead they were each individually rotated just a bit clockwise. I don’t know why this happened.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3120" data-orig-width="4160"><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/b9ef840e5d6a2b79bd5d0bb9ead9601b/tumblr_inline_nyyr8jY2D71qjj3vh_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3120" data-orig-width="4160"/></figure><p>But I figured they were close enough to work, so I used that stencil without trying to debug the process. Otherwise everything was as Cathy said.</p><p>I used an old shopping loyalty card to spread the solder paste. I don’t have a lot to say here because it was fairly easy. I shone a light at an angle that let me see whether any of the pads were still shiny, and if they were I went over them again.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3052" data-orig-width="3120"><img src="http://65.media.tumblr.com/68f5bb205e8556f8671cbd175cf27c4d/tumblr_inline_nyyre35Ien1qjj3vh_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3052" data-orig-width="3120"/></figure><p>After <a href="/post/133444522781/hot-plate-soldering">reflow</a>, only one piece failed: the reset switch on the very end hadn’t reflowed, so it fell off while I was moving the boards around. I touched up with a regular soldering iron, and it was fine.</p><p>I decided to throw away the stencil after these eight boards because it was dirty. I got 25 sheets of 8.5-inch by 11-inch mylar for $14.50, and this was just a small rectangle of one of those sheets, and making the stencil was so easy that it didn’t feel precious.</p><p>Pick and place is still a horrible, horrible experience. My eyes hurt, my back hurts, and I feel silly crawling around on my floor looking for one-cent SMT components that have flicked themselves off my table. (Fun game: find the upside-down 0805 resistor in this picture.)</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4160" data-orig-width="3120"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/27ebf1211fbb3b27009236e9739e099f/tumblr_inline_nyyrtrDSzF1qjj3vh_540.jpg" data-orig-height="4160" data-orig-width="3120"/></figure>
