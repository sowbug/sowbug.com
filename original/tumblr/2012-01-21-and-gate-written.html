<p>I got something to build in the Xilinx ISE:</p>
<pre>library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity foo is
    Port ( port0 : in  STD_LOGIC;
           port1 : in  STD_LOGIC;
           port_out : out  STD_LOGIC);
end foo;

architecture Behavioral of foo is
begin
 port_out &lt;= port0 and port1;
end Behavioral;</pre>
<p>All it does is (in theory) set a high voltage on one pin when a high voltage is set on two other pins. But it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
