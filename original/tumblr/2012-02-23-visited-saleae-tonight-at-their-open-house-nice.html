Nice guys, clean office, lots and lots of <a href="http://www.saleae.com/logic">Logic</a> and <a href="http://www.saleae.com/logic16">Logic 16</a> parts all over the place. My daughter found a broken aluminum shell as a souvenir. It would have been fun to watch them assemble one or to see the Logic 64 or Logic DS or Logic Vita or whatever they have next, but if any of that happened, we missed it.</p>
