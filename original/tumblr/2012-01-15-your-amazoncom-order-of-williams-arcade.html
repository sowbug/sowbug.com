<p>I bought an old CD-ROM of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Williams-Arcade-Classics-PC/dp/B0007SN0RU">Williams Arcade Classics</a></em>, which is a collection of ROM images and an emulator that runs on a PC. This means little more than that I&rsquo;ll be legal to possess copies of the game ROMs (besides Joust, which I already own). Sean Riddle has already written <a href="http://seanriddle.com/uncomp.c">code</a> to extract the ROMs from the PC version, but to be honest, I think it&rsquo;s easier to type &ldquo;mame roms&rdquo; into a search engine and see where that leads me.</p>
