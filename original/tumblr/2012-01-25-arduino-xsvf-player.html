<p>I want to program a Xilinx XC9572XL and refuse to buy a $50 dongle to do so. Keywords in my research so far:Â xapp058, <a href="http://www.gadgetfactory.net/gadgetforum/index.php?topic=277.0">XSVF</a>, SVF, JTAG, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinodoodles/">arduiggler</a>. There is an <a href="http://openschemes.com/2011/10/25/bit-bang-jtag-programming-of-xilinx-cpld-using-ft232-homebrew-svf-player/">FT232-based version</a> that seems very close to what I want, but it&rsquo;s written in Visual Basic, of all things, and probably won&rsquo;t work on a modern non-FTDI Arduino.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and do contract programming in exchange for karma, please write it in Python to avoid cross-platform issues!</p>
