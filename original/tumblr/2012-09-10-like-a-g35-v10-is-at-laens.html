<p>Just submitted the design to the fancy new <a href="http://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a> site. This is my first time using the site since Laen turned the Dorkbot PDX service into it. The site has a bug or nit here or there, but the previewing feature is very nice.</p>
<p>As expected, I ditched the RTC feature. But I kept the IR receiver. There are terminal blocks for three G35 strands, up to three independent WS2801 strands, and ample power for all passed directly through the fuseless micro-USB power-only connector. How many lights the Arduino processor itself can drive remains to be seen. The board is completely passive; there isn&rsquo;t even a capacitor on it. The major challenge was making sure everything fit without bumping on the metal USB jacket of pre-Leonardo Arduinos.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/like-a-g35">EAGLE files</a> are on GitHub.Â </p>
