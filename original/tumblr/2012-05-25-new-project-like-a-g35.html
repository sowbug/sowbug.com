<p>Last year I took some good work by <a href="http://www.deepdarc.com/2010/11/27/hacking-christmas-lights/">Robert Sun Quattlebaum</a>Â and others and made an <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/G35Arduino">Arduino library</a> that controls GE G35 Color Effects Christmas lights. For the 2011 season I whipped up a quick perfboard using a <a href="http://pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a>, and since then I&rsquo;ve wanted to build a more permanent board that I might leave up year-round; after all, plenty of evenings call for fancy lighting. Why let Christmas have all the fun?</p>
<p>Thus, a few days ago I started my latest project: <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/like-a-g35">Like A G35</a>. It isn&rsquo;t much at the moment, but if I start prototyping now (in May), it ought to be ready to go by the time I want to deploy it (Halloween at the latest).</p>
<p>The circuit will be my first based on the ATmega32U4. I&rsquo;ve worked on that chip quite a bit via <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/products/atmega32u4breakout/">Adafruit&rsquo;s breakout board</a>, but I&rsquo;ve never gotten around to a build with it. It&rsquo;ll be fairly simple:</p>
<ul><li>Micro-USB socket for programming and power.</li>
<li>ISP6 header for initial programming (remember, the &lsquo;32U4 isn&rsquo;t available in DIP).</li>
<li>Three 3-position terminal blocks to support up to three strands of lights.</li>
<li>A second two-position terminal block for alternate power.</li>
<li>A beefy voltage regulator (at least 6 amps if I want to support three strands).</li>
<li>An infrared receiver to change programs.</li>
<li>A PCF8523 real-time clock with battery backup to display different programs depending on time of year.</li>
<li>Pinouts for whichever GPIO pins are left on the chip.</li>
</ul><p>In all likelihood I&rsquo;ll solder only the USB socket, the '32U4, and two of the terminal blocks, because I have only two strands on my house, I prefer to power directly through USB, and I won&rsquo;t get around to any RTC or remote functionality. But in case other people want to build the board and use it for other purposes, it&rsquo;ll be nice to have those other features optionally available.</p>
