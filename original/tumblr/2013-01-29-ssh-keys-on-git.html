<p>Long ago on a Q&amp;A site I used to frequent, I asked why GitHub didn&rsquo;t let me associate a single SSH public key with two accounts. I had a work account and a personal account on GitHub, I wanted to use them both on one computer, and it&rsquo;s a pain in the neck to get Git to use the right one of multiple SSH keys to connect to a single host. (It&rsquo;s solvable; you have to change your ssh configuration to define different Hosts, each with a different key, that resolve to the same hostname, and then tell Git to connect to a Host rather than a hostname.) I imagined that GitHub should be able to say that if I&rsquo;m connecting to Repository X with Key A, I&rsquo;d be recognized as Person M, but I&rsquo;d be recognized as Person N with the same key in Repository Y. Why couldn&rsquo;t GitHub do this?</p>
<p>I got a perfectly reasonable answer right away on the Q&amp;A site that GitHub uses SSH to tell who you were, so it can&rsquo;t be done from a technical perspective. I found the answer wanting, though &ndash; why did GitHub use SSH? Why couldn&rsquo;t the SSH identity map to a different concept? Wasn&rsquo;t this SSH-owns-identity thing a big price to pay?</p>
<p>I got the answer while reading <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols">Pro Git</a>. It turns out that Git doesn&rsquo;t know anything about authentication, and SSH is the only practical wrapper protocol that allows write access to a repository. (The other protocols are local file access, the completely anonymous Git protocol, and HTTP, but none easily allows authenticated access.) So it&rsquo;s likely that on a given server, the git process is running as &ldquo;you&rdquo; (whoever you are who ssh'ed into the server), and the sysadmin has set up standard Unix permissions on the .git repo directory to control who has read/write access. Thus Git read/write operations are automatically permitted or not without a single line of code in Git. Very Unix-y.</p>
<p>Does this mean that my original feature request (SSH Key A means you&rsquo;re Person M in Repo X and Person N in Repo Y) is impossible? No; there is probably a way to map an SSH user to a specific machine user based on contextual clues like the directory you&rsquo;re trying to access. But the way it is today, where SSH Key M means you&rsquo;re Person M only and nobody else, is a lot easier from the perspective of someone hacking together a young service like GitHub and making a bunch of shell scripts that set access properly across repositories. Moreover, it avoids the edge case where Person M joins Person N&rsquo;s company and now has access to Repo Y, so the already-weirdish heuristic to determine who you are breaks down. The higher-level solution GitHub came up with, Organizations, solves the problem more elegantly without requiring (or allowing) a single person to assume multiple identities on the system.</p>
