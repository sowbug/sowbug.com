<p>All the search results for [linux nexys2] discuss how the heck you run that djtgtgtgjdsasdfghjkcfg Digilent tool on Linux. In other words, how do you program the Nexys2 on Linux?</p>
<p>But what would it take to run Linux <em><strong>on</strong></em> the Nexys2, or a similar medium-sized FPGA? Can you just download an <a href="http://opencores.org/">http://opencores.org/</a> processor that has a gcc toolchain for it, throw in some I/O controllers, and get the kernel booted up? I am so new to FPGA that I can&rsquo;t even do a back-of-the-envelope calculation whether a Linux-capable core, plus glue, would fit. But it would be a fun project to find out!</p>
