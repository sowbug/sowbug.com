title: 'Hi Mike, This is really cool (JTAG Whisperer). I am really interested in trying
  this out with a Teensy 2, wwwpjrccom. I have a couple on hand right now. Those will
  run "serial" at about 1.1 MByte/sec. Jack also sent me a C/Wing board... so I can
  try programming it. Question: the Python side of things. What do I need to do to
  set up Python, where is your code, etc. I have never done Python. I do like communicationg
  with Arduino thru Microsoft''s free C# Express. That might be another option...'

<p>Python&rsquo;s at <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>. The blog links to the GitHub project, and it&rsquo;s the top hit on Google for &ldquo;jtag whisperer.&rdquo; If you have trouble running it, let me know. I&rsquo;m not going to be the best authority on setting up Python, but there are (probably) a zillion howtos out there. Good luck and let me know how it goes!</p>
