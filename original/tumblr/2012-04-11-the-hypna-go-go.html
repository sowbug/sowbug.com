<p>I&rsquo;ve seen these crazy lucid-dreaming goggle projects for years, but recently stumbled across a really simple one on <a href="http://instructables.com/id/The-Lucid-Dream-Machine/">Instructables</a>. I happened to have all the parts around the house, so I made one. I&rsquo;ve since <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo">improved the firmware</a> and designed a real circuit board that is off at Laen&rsquo;s. The improvements are that the circuit board is smaller, and the firmware is lower-power and better synchronized with a typical 8-hour-sleep REM schedule.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo">GitHub project</a>, it hasn&rsquo;t worked for me over three nights of testing. I have two theories.</p>
<p>One theory is that the lights aren&rsquo;t bright enough. I used some very old red LEDs with about 140 ohms of resistance. They&rsquo;re completely visible to me in my tests, but it might not be enough for my sleeping brain to notice.</p>
<p>The other theory is that it actually is working, but I&rsquo;m not remembering any of it when I wake up. This is a distinct possibility because I almost never remember dreams. They say that teaching yourself to remember your dreams is the first step in improved dream awareness. I&rsquo;ll work on that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here&rsquo;s a picture of what I built, and you can also check out the EAGLE files and the AVR code.</p>
