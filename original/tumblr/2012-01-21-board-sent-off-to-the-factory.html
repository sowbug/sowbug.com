<p>No, not the replacement for the <a href="/post/16180992985/address-and-data-bus-lines-are-now-connected">Mess O&rsquo; Wires</a>. This is the <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/">Dangerous Prototypes</a> <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/XC9500XL_CPLD_breakout_board">XC9500XL CPLD Breakout Board</a>. I&rsquo;ve ordered from <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">DorkbotPDX</a>, and my batch should be going to the fab today.Â (As a side note, I don&rsquo;t feel too bad about depriving DP of revenue. I own one of approximately every other thing they&rsquo;ve sold, and I couldn&rsquo;t wait for the many-week shipment time from <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/">SeeedStudio</a>.)</p>
<p>As I investigate (naively) the capabilities of this device, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I ought to be able to duplicate all of Joust with the following:</p>
<ul><li>A Xilinx Spartan of some kind to reproduce the main chips (6809E, two 6821s, a 6808 for sound, and the &ldquo;special&rdquo; SC2) and a lot of the glue among them.</li>
<li>One of these little CPLDs for things like the Q/E clock generator and other glue that might not fit on the Spartan. (Actually, I doubt it&rsquo;ll be necessary at all, but I&rsquo;m rationalizing it now so I can start working on programmable logic before the Spartan arrives.)</li>
<li>An SRAM.</li>
<li>An EEPROM to hold the game code.</li>
<li>The 4MHz oscillator.</li>
<li>An ATmega of some kind to load up the Spartan and maybe manage resets.</li>
<li>A bunch of resistors for video, and capacitors for power decoupling.</li>
</ul><p>Unless I&rsquo;m missing something major, this will be a pretty tiny board, compared to the original five Joust boards!</p>
