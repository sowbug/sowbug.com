<p>I reached a good 1.0 stopping point, so I poured the ground planes, fired up the CAM processor, churned out the gerbers, and emailed 1.46 square inches of high functionality to <a href="http://dementeddiode.org/blog/">Laen&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">DorkbotPDX PCB service</a>!</p>

<p>Many thanks to DG who manually routed a interim version of the board, and shaved off all but four vias and about a half square-inch of PCB. Unfortunately I made a few more enhancements and added 14 more vias in the process. Here&rsquo;s the current feature set:</p>
<ul><li>ATmega8u2, 16MHz</li>
<li>Will program any ISP6-capable AVR</li>
<li>Will play XSVF via JTAG headers</li>
<li>Powered by USB</li>
<li>Mini-USB connector</li>
<li>Buffered I/O</li>
<li>Requires no 6-pin cable</li>
<li>Will power the target board at 5V (about 450mA) or 3.3V (about 100mA)</li>
<li>Target board can also be self-powered</li>
<li>I/O logic levels will always match target VCC (unless user does something silly)</li>
<li>Optional self-programming header</li>
<li>Optional secondary ISP6 header if you <em>really</em> want to use a cable, or need to connect to an ISP10 board, or just want to hack hard on the 8u2 and prefer flying leads.</li>
</ul><p>At this point all I can truly say is that <em>the hardware doesn&rsquo;t rule out any of this functionality.</em> I haven&rsquo;t written the software yet, so the board doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything. But it will.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sowbug/avr-programmer">Watch the project</a> on GitHub! And if you&rsquo;re interested in a prototype of the board, let me know!</p>
