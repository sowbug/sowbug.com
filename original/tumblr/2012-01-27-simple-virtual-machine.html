<a href="http://syprog.blogspot.com/2011/12/simple-virtual-machine.html">Simple Virtual Machine</a><br/><p>Summary: here&rsquo;s how to design a computing machine and tools to build programs for it. Oh, and here are the actual machine and tools, too.</p>
<p>I love articles like this because they&rsquo;re a reminder of how simple computers are. They move electrons from one place to another in a predictable fashion. Sure, any hardware or software out in the real world is many times more complex than the little virtual machine in this article, but it&rsquo;s reassuring from time to time to clear away the outer layers of computing and confirm that it&rsquo;s quite simple inside.</p>
