<p>I can&rsquo;t find any description of these lights online. They&rsquo;re like mini Christmas lights, with a gentle bluish glow that is too faint to read by, but too bright to be an all-night night light for my kids. A string of 48 costs $13: not cheap by IKEA standards, but reasonable. There is no switch.</p>

<p>The AC adapter puts out 21 volts, 90 mA, which I&rsquo;m guessing is DC because the low-voltage plug is polarized. The Kill-a-Watt measures 0 watts.</p>

<p>I think I can kill a few birds with one stone. A small circuit spliced in between the transformer and the lights could provide a 30-minute gradual PWM dimming timer for the kids. They&rsquo;d press the button to start the sequence, and fall asleep as the lights went out. The board would sip power from the adapter.</p>

<p>The 21 volts are a challenge. Might be fun.</p>
