title: Awesome work on JTAGWhisperer!  Been reading all about this project and ran
  into a hitch. First my setup...  I'm using an Arduino Duemilanove with 4 channel
  bidirectional logic level converter and trying to program my Taio xilinx Coolrunner
  II (XC2C64A).  I get the ready to send output, and then confirmation that the device
  is ready.  After that it freezes after sending 32 bytes, no matter what xsvf I try
  and program to the CPLD.  TDO is high at 3.3v on the CPLD, but just hangs.  Any
  thoughts?

<p>When I was debugging this thing, the Arduino serial connection (which uses software flow control, a.k.a. no flow control) was getting confused or falling behind. Try setting both sides to a very low bitrate (like 9600 or 2400).</p>
<p>Do you have a logic analyzer? That was invaluable in isolating problems.</p>
<p>Are you sure that the target board doesn&rsquo;t have any jumper/power requirements? My board needed two power sources: one for the core, and one for the I/O.</p>
<p>The smallest possible XSVF is one asking for the device ID and ending. That one&rsquo;s also attractive because it doesn&rsquo;t involve writing (which can be very finicky about voltage levels).</p>
<p>Be sure your XSVFs are generated specifically for your chip. The ones in the repo are for a XC9572XL, which is incompatible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I can think of right now.Â </p>
