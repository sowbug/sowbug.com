<p>In the middle of a great email exchange with <a href="http://seanriddle.com/">Sean Riddle</a> (the all-time PageRank leader for Williams hardware and software), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a> came up. It&rsquo;s an old philosophical puzzle where a ship sails around the world, in the process having broken and worn-out parts replaced as needed. By the time it arrives back in its home port, every part has been replaced. <em>Question: is it still the same ship?</em></p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a project code name! So here&rsquo;s the proposal: <strong>8821</strong> is project to understand how a 6809 works in the year 2012. <strong>Theseus</strong> is the project to resurrect an old Joust while keeping its identity as a Joust. File your objections with the Review Board within five business days.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2/1/2012: This name didn&rsquo;t stick. It sounds too much like &ldquo;thesis,&rdquo; and I avoided grad school precisely so I&rsquo;d never have to work on one of those.</strong></p>
