  to see if anyone had any interesting images to flash onto it.  dead link brought
  me here.  also local.  was seeing if you had anything archived away.  i have all
  the ethernet hardware - just an old project I never got around to.  cheers

<p>Awesome! Give this a try: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/131036/audrey/audrey_redist.iso">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/131036/audrey/audrey_redist.iso</a> and let me know if you get anywhere with it. I am not sure whether those qualify as interesting, but they’re the originals that others used to build better ones.</p>
