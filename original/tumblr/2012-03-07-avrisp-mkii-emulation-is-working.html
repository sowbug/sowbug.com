<p>Using my USPtinyISP, I burned the LUFA CDC bootloader to my 32u4. Then I bootloaded <a href="http://fourwalledcubicle.com/">Dean</a>&rsquo;s LUFA-based AVRISP mkII-compatible ISP firmware onto it. Finally, I used the 32u4 masquerading as a mkII to read and set fuses on an ATtiny13a.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that when the AVR programmer boards arrive from Laen, I ought to be able to quickly build basic firmware for them. Exciting!</p>
