<p>This works for the <a href="http://amzn.to/1jLwkVf">blue FIDO U2F key</a>.</p><p>Create a new file called <b>/etc/udev/rules.d/50-security-key.rules</b>:</p><p><code><b>SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", OWNER="root", GROUP="plugdev", MODE:="0660"</b></code></p><p>Once that file is saved, <b>sudo udevadm control &ndash;reload-rules</b> and then restart Chrome. Your security key, which previously was likely giving you a “An unexpected error occurred [retry]” message, will now work.</p><p>I figured this out with the command <b>udevadm info -n /dev/usb/hiddev0 -a</b>, inspecting the output to determine that other solutions on the web were missing the S at the end of SUBSYSTEMS and ATTRS. For the assignment parts of the udev rule, the values root/plugdev/0660 were correct.</p>
