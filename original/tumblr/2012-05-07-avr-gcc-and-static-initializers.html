<p>In the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/FAQ.html">avr-gcc FAQ</a>, the question &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I initialize all my variables?&rdquo; gives a hint why your nonzero static initializers aren&rsquo;t working:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[G]lobal and static variables that have an initializer go into the .data section of the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had been seeing static variables without a declared assignment correctly initialized to zero, but any nonzero initialization didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything. But reading the FAQ led me to examine my makefile, where I found this interesting section:</p>
<blockquote><code>%.hex : main.obj<br/><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>$(OBJ2HEX) -j .text -O ihex $&lt; $@</code></blockquote>
<p>Aha! So avr-gcc was likely putting the initialized variables into .data, but I was omitting that section when generating the Intel hexfile. Adding another -j section for .data fixed it.</p>
