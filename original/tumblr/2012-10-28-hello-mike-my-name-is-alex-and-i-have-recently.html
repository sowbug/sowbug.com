title: Hello Mike, my name is Alex and I have recently started dabbling in the G35
  Arduino lighting control.  I recently purchased an Arduino Uno and was trying to
  set up your basic example sketch but can't seem to get it to load as it gives me
  an error "G35String" does not name a type.  My goal is to set up some G35 lights
  w/ColorNode boards which I've purchased and populated, along with a JeeNode and
  JeeLink for control.

<p>Have you followed the installation instructions exactly? I just did so with a clean Arduino installation, and it worked. The error you&rsquo;re seeing suggests you&rsquo;ve taken just the example sketch but haven&rsquo;t installed the library.Â </p>
