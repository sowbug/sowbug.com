<p>I had a good debugging session over the last few nights and want to write down my notes here.</p>
<p>The <a href="/post/19682029334/the-programmer-works">AVR Programmer</a> initially worked with a target &lsquo;328p, but it hung when programming a second build of the board, and then again on a particular ATtiny13A that I was using for the <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-go-go">Hypna Go Go</a>. Oddly, it worked for another '13A that I was using on the same project. The board was flaky, and as a result, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my promise to myself to never again ISP-program another AVR without a programmer I&rsquo;d built myself.</p>
<p>A few nights ago, while getting ready for the latest and greatest version of the board to arrive from the factory, I decided to take a look at what was going on. I got out my <a href="http://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic</a> and watched the SPI traffic. Perfect&hellip; except that the target '13A never responded on MISO. I swapped in a known-good programmer, confirmed it worked, but then saw that the logic signal patterns were identical. <em>The target wasn&rsquo;t responding, but the known-good programmer was programming it!</em></p>
<p>I suspected bad logic probe connections&hellip; nope. They were fine.</p>
<p>Getting a bit frantic, I zoomed out in the Logic app, and immediately figured out why the target wasn&rsquo;t responding. The first cycle through the initialization sequence (the only cycle I&rsquo;d been examining), it always failed. But the second cycle succeeded, and I never saw this until I zoomed out.</p>
<p>Next question: why was the known-good good? I re-read the datasheet for the '13A and saw that if the programmer couldn&rsquo;t guarantee SCK was low on target powerup (which indeed applied in both my and the known-good programmer cases), an alternate way to get into programming mode was to pulse /RESET high for a bit. I could see the known-good doing this between the first bad and second good cycles, and my firmware was doing the same thing, so what was the difference?</p>
<p>Back to my programmer under the logic analyzer. Zoom out&hellip; and see that in fact /RESET was staying low consistently. Aha! That&rsquo;s the problem. But why was it happening?</p>
<p>It turns out that the LUFA code doesn&rsquo;t pulse /RESET by sending it high. Instead it <em>tristates</em> the pin. This makes sense because you want your programmer to disconnect from the target when you&rsquo;re done so that /RESET can go back high on its own. This is fine, except that my programmer has a 74AHC125 buffer between the '32u2 and the ISP outputs, and <em>a tristate output entering the buffer leaves as a low logic signal</em>. This is why my programmer wasn&rsquo;t pulsing /RESET, and it&rsquo;s why programming <em>sometimes</em> worked if the powerup sequence happened to be right, or if the chip in question (such as most 328p&rsquo;s or some 13A&rsquo;s) happened to be a more tolerant sample.</p>
<p>Once I understood the problem, <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/lufa-lib/commit/258ecc31c993826bf5c520699c38b9d8183b00cb">the fix was easy</a>. Change LUFA to pulse /RESET with explicit logic levels, and insert buffer enable/disable code at the appropriate places. So far, it&rsquo;s been running flawlessly.</p>
