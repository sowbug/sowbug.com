<p>The <a href="/hypnagogo">Hypna Go Go</a> recently woke me up three times in one night. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo/commit/19dad15bac9c3044ce51e20b6702617b921ee203#firmware/main.c">adjusted the lighting algorithm</a> to fade in gently, and hope this will help.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Progress. I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_awakening">false awakening</a> after this change, in which I took off my sleep mask and tried to shut off the HGG, but discovered the battery was getting weak. Then in real life my kids woke me up. I consider this to be progress because it was my first reaction to the lights where I didn&rsquo;t wake up. Unfortunately, rather than realizing I was dreaming, I did what I usually do when the lights wake me up: I take off the mask and shut off the device.</strong></p>
