<ul><li>Move to protoboard and do permanent wiring underneath with headers on top for further experimentation.</li>
<li>Split out into two or more breadboards with ribbon connectors between them. This isn&rsquo;t actually any better than what I have now, but it&rsquo;d be a chance to refactor the wiring and IC arrangement.</li>
<li>Fire up EAGLE and redo the circuit as a schematic, then route it and ship it off to be manufactured, maybe by <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">DorkbotPDX</a> if the timing works out right and I&rsquo;m patient, or somewhere else if I want to spend more money and get it faster.</li>
<li>Sit and wait for the Papilio One to arrive (which I ordered a couple weeks ago), and in theory enjoy working mostly in software until I run into BRAM limits.</li>
</ul>
