Usually a great time to bang out a few dozen lines of code!</p>
<p>On the screen you can compare the bytes to be loaded ($12, $12, $12, $0e, $fe) with the lower nibbles implied by the logic analyzer ($2, $2, $2, $e, $e) and confirm they match up. I haven&rsquo;t tested the address lines yet. We&rsquo;re getting close to hooking up ROM (or SRAM that&rsquo;s not writeable) to the '09!</p>
