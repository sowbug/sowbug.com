<p>I killed my <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/CPLD:_Complex_programmable_logic_devices">CPLD Breakout Board</a>. While taking pictures of the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; SRAM-loading VHDL I&rsquo;d written and wired up, I noticed that the power LED on the board was off. I checked the connections, toggled the power a few times, tried re-running the logic analyzer, and eventually concluded that the board was dead. It draws 1.4 amps when I plug it in, and the CPLD itself gets pretty hot. As far as I can tell, everything else on the board is working (except for the power LED, which now appears to be inert).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my VHDL:</p>
<pre>architecture Behavioral of SRAM_LOADER is
  signal REGISTER_TEMP : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(23 downto 0);
begin
  process (CLK)
  begin
    if (rising_edge(CLK)) then
      REGISTER_TEMP &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(22 downto 0) &amp; LATCH;
      if OE = '1' then
        ADDRESS &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(23 downto 8);
        DATA &lt;= REGISTER_TEMP(7 downto 0);
      else
        ADDRESS &lt;= "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ";
        DATA &lt;= "ZZZZZZZZ";
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end Behavioral;</pre>
<p>I think the tri-stated address and data pins are the problem. None of them were connected to anything (except four data pins hooked to my logic analyzer). But I&rsquo;m not at all sure why that would be a problem. The only reason I think it&rsquo;s related is that one of the last things I did was testing OE disabled (grounded), but it wasn&rsquo;t the <em>last</em> thing (which was one more OE-high run to take a picture of the registers shifting), so even that evidence is questionable. If I&rsquo;d obviously shorted something external to the chip, then I doubt I&rsquo;d have been able to spend the half-hour or so when I successfully tested it. That&rsquo;s why I believe I did something wrong with the tri-stating.</p>
<p>If you know a way that one could destroy an XC9572XL CPLD by programming it incorrectly, I&rsquo;d appreciate a tip. </p>
