<p>Please pardon a slightly off-topic post. This isn&rsquo;t about electronics, but it&rsquo;s about making more people who might make electronics, so it&rsquo;s almost relevant.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon my seven-year-old son asked if I&rsquo;d let him play Quake 3 on my desktop computer. I said sure and walked him through bringing up the Ubuntu Unity menu, typing in &ldquo;ioquake,&rdquo; and so on, until he&rsquo;d started a multiplayer game populated with several bot enemies. All was well and I returned to fiddling with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.</p>
<p>Then came the Tech Support call: &ldquo;DAD!!!&rdquo; My son had navigated down into some odd menu I&rsquo;d never seen, and both of us needed some time to figure out what was going on. We hit escape, got our bearings, and he was back manufacturing gibs once again. I told him to stick to the main options in the menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, Dad.&quot; And back to Twilio.</p>
<p>&quot;DAD!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he&rsquo;d done something kind of interesting. He&rsquo;d opened the Quake console and had gotten into some state that seemed unrecoverable except for quitting. I was about to repeat my &ldquo;stick to the main&rdquo; admonition, except this time phrased as a &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m Dad &ndash; now it&rsquo;s a rule &ndash; disobedience forbidden &ndash; on pain of punishment&rdquo; kind of parental edict.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I caught myself, just before the words left my mouth. <em>My son was doing exactly what I used to do when I was learning computers.</em> He was exploring every path in the UI, seeing what would happen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sowbug-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936719002">poking the box</a>. This was hacking. This was the satisfaction of curiosity, the development of proficiency, the beginning of true understanding. This was my son being a geek.</p>
<p>My irritation subsided. Awe replaced it. I stepped back, literally and figuratively. I nudged him a bit to get him unstuck, as he&rsquo;d asked me to, but I let him keep exploring the <em>real</em> game that he wanted to play &ndash; the user interface of this shoot &lsquo;em up.</p>
