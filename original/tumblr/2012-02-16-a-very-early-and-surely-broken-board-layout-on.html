The socketed chip in the middle is the SRAM, and the one on the right is the 6809E. The middle guys are the CPLD, an ATmega32u4, and the frickin&rsquo; huge oscillator that I will no doubt replace with an SMD version. A friend has graciously offered to do the layout for real, so I&rsquo;m not too concerned about the ugly EAGLE autoroutes. I just want to get an idea of how big the board will be.</p>
<p>Known errors in this version:</p>
<ul><li>There&rsquo;s no JTAG header. I intend to program the CPLD with the ATmega, but I&rsquo;d like a backup plan.</li>
<li>I might want to consider a fuse. This isn&rsquo;t a general-purpose board with wildly varying current needs or likelihood of short-circuits, but still, it&rsquo;d be smart.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no circuitry to choose between USB and jack power sources. I&rsquo;m OK with this; if I plug in both simultaneously, I deserve the consequences.</li>
<li>I phoned in the capacitor placement. I will read the datasheets and take their advice.</li>
<li>As-is, any SD card placed in the board would burn up. Voltage-dividing resistors between the 5V &lsquo;32u4 and the 3.3V card signals are needed.</li>
<li>Like the oscillator, the SRAM could be switched to an SMD version. Only the 6809E is unavailable as an SMD.</li>
</ul><p>Missing functionality:</p>
<ul><li>Video.</li>
<li>Sound.</li>
<li>Game inputs.</li>
<li>Anything that could even theoretically serve as the Williams Special Chip.</li>
<li>Header sockets for a future stacked board that will eventually contain all of the above.</li>
</ul><p>But this is OK. As long as I add the headers, this will serve as a fairly functionally complete 6809E-based computer with persistent storage, huge DRAM, huge ROM, and&hellip; virtually no way to demonstrate that it&rsquo;s doing anything at all except through a logic analyzer or maybe <a href="http://quinndunki.com/blondihacks/?p=610">Quinn&rsquo;s HexOut tool</a>. Again, this is OK. I&rsquo;ll add the second stackable board, and that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;ll start to do cool stuff.</p>
<p>Parting thought: if the SRAM is an SMD, the 6809E is rotated 90 degrees, and things are scrunched together as closely as possible, then it&rsquo;s starting to look a lot like a very special-purpose Arduino shield. The Arduino would replace the ATmega, the crystal, the power circuitry, and the ISP header. That saves a <em>lot</em> of room on the board. In fact, it might even leave room for v2 to have everything from the missing-stuff list. Hmmm.</p>
