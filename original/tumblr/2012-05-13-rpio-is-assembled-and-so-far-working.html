<p>I assembled one of the SeeedStudio boards and began testing. The power sections appear to work correctly, the project LEDs all behave as expected, and the TXB0108 I/Os are not surprising me (that&rsquo;s a qualified statement because I haven&rsquo;t yet run them all the way through their paces).</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet tried the two I2C circuits. Once I&rsquo;ve completed this testing, I&rsquo;ll have done pretty much everything I can before getting access to a real board.</p>

<p>As you can see from this preassembly photo, I mistakenly ordered 0603 resistors rather than the 0805 size that the layout intended. But having assembled the board, I can say without hesitation that <em>soldering 0603 parts onto 0805 pads is sheer delight</em>. It&rsquo;s like moving into a loft with no furniture yet; there&rsquo;s just so much room!</p>
