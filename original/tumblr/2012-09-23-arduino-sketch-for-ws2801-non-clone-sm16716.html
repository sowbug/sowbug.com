<p>I got a strand of 50 LED lights from &ldquo;someone in China.&rdquo; They were advertised as being WS2801-based, but they didn&rsquo;t work with Arduino sketches for that chip.</p>
<p>So now I have a 49-light strand, a sacrificial light that I had to rip apart to find the chip identifier (&ldquo;SM16716&rdquo;), and <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/sm16716">an Arduino sketch</a> that proves that they work. Thank you, Google Translate, for help with the Chinese-only datasheet for the 16716.</p>

<p>By the way, there is a probably great library, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fastspi/">FastSPI</a>, that supports many chipsets including the 16716. Unfortunately, it just didn&rsquo;t work for my Uno/strand combination, and I&rsquo;m not sure why (the code looks right). I&rsquo;ll probably debug that code and submit a patch.</p>
