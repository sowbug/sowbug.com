<p>I got the video assembly out of storage, and it&rsquo;s dead. I know that CRTs use high voltages, and I&rsquo;m allergic to kryptonite, so I won&rsquo;t be messing around with that thing. No jousting today. I&rsquo;m also concerned that the sound board isn&rsquo;t doing anything, though it&rsquo;s getting power. I went through the diagnostics in the <a href="http://www.robotron-2084.co.uk/manualsjoust.html">Joust owner&rsquo;s manual</a>, and made it through the flowchart to &ldquo;yep, your machine is busted&rdquo; in all cases. It&rsquo;s a safe assumption there are multiple problems with this 30-year-old machine, aside from the ones I&rsquo;ve fixed so far.</p>
<p>After a break for dinner, I got to thinking. The video output from the CPU board is R, G, B, HSync, and VSync. That sure looks a lot like VGA. Is VGA the same scheme? Do VGA monitors tolerate only certain sync frequencies? Would it&hellip; just work?</p>
