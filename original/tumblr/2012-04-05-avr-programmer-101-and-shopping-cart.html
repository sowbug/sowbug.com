<p>Dennis made some routing improvements after I sent the board to Laen, and I decided to switch to the &lsquo;244 rather than '241 (not checked in yet). But the schematic hasn&rsquo;t changed, so the PCBs we get back should be good enough to validate the design, so we won&rsquo;t have this one manufactured until 1_0_0_FINAL comes back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a partial <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=76637a6c60">shopping cart at Mouser</a>. It&rsquo;s missing the <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/PPTC032LJBN-RC/S5517-ND/775975">right-angle header</a>Â and miscellaneous other headers that we intend to be optionally soldered by the end user. It also has a couple alternative versions of parts; for example, we might want to switch to a stronger micro-USB socket with positioning tabs that fit into PCB holes, because this is the kind of device that will be frequently plugged and unplugged.</p>
<p>The BOM is looking to be about $7.50 exclusive of the PCB, in single-unit quantities.</p>
