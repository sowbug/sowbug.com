<p>The boards arrived from <a href="http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order">Dorkbot</a> yesterday. I learned my lesson from last time and assembled all three in parallel (taking the risk that the circuit was bad and that I&rsquo;d waste 3x the materials). I flashed the bootloader to the first one using the alpha version of the board (in the back with the blue shunt), then self-programmed it over USB with the <a href="http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php">AVRISP mkII</a> firmware. Final test:</p>

<p>I read the fuses from my <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-go-go">Hypna Go Go</a>&rsquo;s ATtiny13A, and I got the lovely <code>Device signature = 0x1e9007</code> that seems to play a critical role in many dreams I recall nowadays. Success!</p>
<p>Bringing up the other two boards was a bit more difficult. The first would program and would blink its bootloader status LED, but it wouldn&rsquo;t program. A cold solder joint on the &lsquo;32u2&rsquo;s core GND pin was the cause. The last board was a more serious case: the '32u2 got hot when I plugged in the USB, and other than being ISP-programmable, it was dead to the world. I never found the short, but I did scrub off the flux more carefully, and I resoldered a couple capacitors that looked slightly suspicious, and when I plugged it back in again, it was fine.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul><li>Validate that the new HWBE jumper works.</li>
<li>Port over the <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/JTAGWhisperer/">JTAG Whisperer</a>.</li>
<li>Expose the USB-TTL serial functionality.</li>
<li>Fix a few layout issues (obscured labels, component placement that is inconvenient for assembly).</li>
<li>Switch to a version of the USB socket that has pegs. I can already tell a high-use application like this is going to need a little more strength than just SMD solder pads.</li>
<li>Replacement of the current-limiting resistor on the LED. Someone please remind me why I picked 1K ohms. My gorgeous purple LEDs are hardly visible!</li>
