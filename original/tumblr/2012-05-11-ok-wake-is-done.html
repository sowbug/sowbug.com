<p>I ran through a full sequence Tuesday night and was happy with what I saw. So I&rsquo;ve tagged the project <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/ok-wake/zipball/FIRMWARE_WORKING_1_0_0">FIRMWARE_WORKING_1_0_0</a>, and after a morning or two to confirm that the actual devices are working, I&rsquo;ll deliver one to my friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to finish projects. The <a href="/hypnagogo">Hypna Go Go</a> is a practical device that I use almost daily, and now OK Wake has the potential to help a friend and his family manage their morning routine. I feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Next tasks: build an <a href="/rpio">RPio</a> (the boards arrived over the weekend, though still no Raspberry Pi on the horizon). And do one more hardware revision of the <a href="/isp">AVR Programmer</a>. I also have a couple more quick projects in mind.</p>
