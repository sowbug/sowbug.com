<p>Just sent off <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/avr-programmer/zipball/DORKBOT_1_0">DORKBOT_1_0</a>Â to Laen (yeah, we reuse version numbers around here). Interesting changes:</p>
<ul><li>Added an FTDI-cable-compatible header. This means the board has the hardware capability to do USB-TTL serial I/O, and it should be able to program Arduino Pros and other barebones Arduinos.</li>
<li>Dropped the two ground pins on the VCC/3.3/5.0 header. The original idea was to make it possible for that header to act as a small power source, but it turned out to be a confusing opportunity for short circuits.</li>
<li>Brought out the 4MHz emergency clock source that Dean&rsquo;s AVRISP source code already provides.</li>
<li>Brought out XCK. In theory, with a couple external resistors connecting TXO and RXI to form the DATA line, TPI/PDI programming will be possible.</li>
<li>Brought out two GPIO pins. They&rsquo;re buffered so they&rsquo;re output-only.</li>
<li>Switched from the &lsquo;125 to a '241 to accommodate the extra outs.</li>
<li>Dropped the redundant pullup resistor on /RESET.</li>
<li>Added a solder jumper for /HWB so it&rsquo;s easier to get the board into bootloader mode.</li>
<li>Stopped sending MISO through the buffer. This was a curious design decision for USBtinyISP, and it also made ISP of the board itself more difficult than it should have been.</li>
<li>Switched to larger-than-microscopic labels. Maybe they&rsquo;ll be readable this time!</li>
</ul>
