<p>Does such a thing exist but simplified for today&rsquo;s ADHD youth like me? Here&rsquo;s what I want:</p>
<ul><li>Name (&lsquo;00)</li>
<li>Description (quad 2-input NAND gate)</li>
<li>A plain English paragraph describing why you&rsquo;d want this chip</li>
<li>Pinout with legend for the abbreviations</li>
<li>Maybe a cool circuit or clever hack using the chip</li>
</ul><p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits">Wikipedia</a>, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t contain all the information in a condensed and complete format, like a PDF that could be printed and kept on a workbench. While there are PDF catalogs on various sites I&rsquo;ve found, they&rsquo;re produced by people trying to sell chips, which unfortunately means they&rsquo;re full of marketing speak and newer circuits that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to buy in quantities &lt; 100,000 anyway.</p>
<p>Totally dorky, but I&rsquo;d love trading cards for the 7400 series. <em>I&rsquo;ll trade you my 12-stage binary ripple counter for your quad 2-input XOR gate!</em></p>
