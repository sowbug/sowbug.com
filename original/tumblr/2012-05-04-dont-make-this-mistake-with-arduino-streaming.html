<p>This happened to me. Don&rsquo;t let it happen to you.</p>
<ol><li>Write a constant somewhere, like Wire.write(0x06). In my case, this was sending an address to an I2C chip, but it could be Serial.write() or something else like that.</li>
<li>Confirm everything&rsquo;s working great.</li>
<li>Later on, change to Wire.write(0x00).</li>
<li>Get a compile error about how the function signature is now ambiguous because zero can be any of multiple types.</li>
<li>Be specific: Wire.write(0x00, HEX).</li>
<li>Confirm everything&rsquo;s working great.</li>
<li>Now copy your earlier code somewhere else: Wire.write(0x04, HEX).</li>
<li>Your I2C device begins emitting lethal radiation focused on nearby kittens.</li>
</ol><p>The mistake started with step 4 (misinterpreting the compile error) and its fate was sealed with step 5. The problem is that the Arduino&rsquo;s print/println methods are slightly different in that they take an optional format argument as the second parameter if the first doesn&rsquo;t fit a single function signature. The streaming APIs, on the other hand, take a pointer and a length. So my Wire.write(0, HEX) was actually Wire.write(address 0, 16 bytes). In Step 6 I just got lucky that whatever I wrote to the device didn&rsquo;t change behavior much, but Step 7 my luck ran out.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: print takes a format specifier. Streaming libraries take a length. If you mix them up, it still builds.</strong></p>
