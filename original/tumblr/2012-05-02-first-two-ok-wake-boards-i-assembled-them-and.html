I assembled them and wrote a quickie program to test that everything was wired up properly. I haven&rsquo;t yet run the PCF8523 real-time clock through its paces, but everything else is working properly.</p>
<p>This board is going to require some nontrivial firmware, and I haven&rsquo;t ever worked with I2C (or the generic-brand TWI, or two-wire interface) on an AVR, which means this is going to be a significant opportunity to learn. Because I didn&rsquo;t have the space for an ISP header, I&rsquo;ll probably develop most of the firmware on an Arduino or Adafruit &lsquo;32u4 breakout board to avoid having to constantly unplug the ATtiny25. That will speed up development time, I hope.</p>
<p>I did make one mistake in this circuit. I had a half-baked idea that a 10uF capacitor could power the RTC during battery changes. I have absolutely no basis for my belief that that capacitor is large enough to power the RTC during the 30 seconds it&rsquo;d take to change the battery, but even if it were, I neglected to put a diode in the circuit to stop the ATtiny from quickly draining the capacitor. This probably means that changing the battery will be disruptive. Fortunately, I expect the lifetime of the battery to exceed the useful lifetime of the board (remember, this is for a friend&rsquo;s children who aren&rsquo;t yet old enough to read a clock but are likely to respect a color-coded admonition to stay in bed, and I&rsquo;m sure that in a year they&rsquo;ll have grown out of that phase).</p>
