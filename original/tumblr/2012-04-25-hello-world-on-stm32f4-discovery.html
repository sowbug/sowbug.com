<p>I got a blinking LED (the embedded Hello World) on my <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/252419.jsp">STM32F4 Discovery</a> board. It probably would have been easy to do, except that I was on OS X. Here are the steps I took:</p>
<ol><li>Tried a bunch of stuff.</li>
<li>Switch to Linux.</li>
<li>Tried a bunch more stuff.</li>
<li>Took a break.</li>
<li>Found this <a href="http://www.triplespark.net/elec/pdev/arm/stm32.html">extremely correct page</a>, which helped me build a real ARM toolchain.</li>
<li>BuiltÂ <a href="https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain">stlink</a>.</li>
<li>Built some of the stlink samples.</li>
<li>Got gdb going with the stlink gdbserver.</li>
<li>Stepped through some code in RAM (not flashed).</li>
<li>Using the stlink flash utility, flashed code I built to the board. Unplugged it and plugged it back in to confirm the code was still there.</li>
<li>Flashed back the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; sample shipped with the board.</li>
</ol><p>From this adventure I can confirm that summon-arm-toolchain does work if you switch to the dev branch, and that the ARM version of gdb really and truly allows interactive debugging on this tiny little dev board. Quite a step up from the AT90S4433 and early avr-gcc toolchain that I first started hacking on back in 2002.</p>
