<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_lyxzogfhWv1qly645o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Not to blame. These are two 100uF capacitors that were recently on the main board of the Wells-Gardner 19&quot; K7201 monitor in my Joust. They&rsquo;d obviously burst over the years (notice the bulge in the cross-shaped tops), so I replaced them. Fingers crossed, powered up&hellip; and just as dead as before.</p>
