<a href="https://github.com/sowbug/rpio">RPio: A Raspberry Pi Breakout Board</a><br/><p>This weekend I whipped up a breakout board for the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/rpio">RPio</a>Â bidirectionally level-shifts the GPIO pins between their 3.3-volt level and a more hobbyist-friendly 5 volts. It also provides more 3.3-volt power than the meager 50mA provided from the RPi&rsquo;s expansion header. My own Raspberry Pi order isn&rsquo;t due to be fulfilled until the late Spring, so I&rsquo;m in no great big hurry to build my own. But if you&rsquo;re interested in getting one, please let me know.</p>
