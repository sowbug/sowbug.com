<p>If you want to use <a href="http://www.google.com/slides/about/">Google Slides</a> to make an <a href="http://igniteshow.com/">Ignite</a>-style presentation where the 20 slides are each 15 seconds, throw this animated GIF in the corner of the master. Want to make your own? <a href="https://github.com/sowbug/clockgif">Check out the repository</a> and customize it.</p>
<p>There are 20 copies of the 15-second sequence in the GIF. This is for two reasons. First, Slides doesn&rsquo;t reload the GIF between transitions, so if you had a single 15-second non-looping GIF, it would halt after the first slide. Using a non-looping GIF lets you add some slide-to-slide animations, such as a yellow progress bar telling you how far you are in the presentation.</p>
