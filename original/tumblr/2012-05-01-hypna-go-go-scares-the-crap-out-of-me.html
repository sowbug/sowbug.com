<p>A couple nights ago I had my first <a href="/post/20906913903/the-hypna-go-go">Hypna Go Go</a>-influenced dream. I don&rsquo;t remember what had been happening in the dream, but suddenly a bright drag-race-Christmas-tree-style pole of lights appeared right in front of me. I realized that this was my signal that I was dreaming. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t shake my dream-world concern <em>why</em> the big red lights were flashing; was it an ambulance? Was it a traffic jam or an accident? Were my family members hurt? The next couple moments of the dream were vague and unpleasant, and I woke up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to change anything with the device for now. Yes, the lights are probably a little too bright, but having replayed the light-pole event in my mind several times while awake, I believe I can train myself so that next time it won&rsquo;t be a distressing experience.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at dream recall. I&rsquo;ve written down about ten dreams, and have been aware that I&rsquo;ve forgotten nearly as many more. This is much better than a few weeks ago, when it seemed that I had no dreams at all. And lately I&rsquo;ve been having a sense of general well-being about the world, which I would expect given that my dreams are often about seeing old friends and being in interesting places. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s Spring in my part of the world.</p>
