I can't find any description of these lights online. They're like mini
Christmas lights, with a gentle bluish glow that is too faint to read by, but
too bright to be an all-night night light for my kids. A string of 48 costs
$13: not cheap by IKEA standards, but reasonable. There is no switch.

The AC adapter puts out 21 volts, 90 mA, which I'm guessing is DC because the
low-voltage plug is polarized. The Kill-a-Watt measures 0 watts.

I think I can kill a few birds with one stone. A small circuit spliced in
between the transformer and the lights could provide a 30-minute gradual PWM
dimming timer for the kids. They'd press the button to start the sequence, and
fall asleep as the lights went out. The board would sip power from the
adapter.

The 21 volts are a challenge. Might be fun.
