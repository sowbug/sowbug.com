Supercapacitor + incredibly high efficiency LED. The light switch is actually
an inductive-charging receiver. To switch on the light, you place your phone
near the switch. The phone charges the supercapacitor, and the light stays on
for a reasonable amount of time.

Application: a picture frame, hung on the wall, where you want to be able to
provide spot lighting for the picture but don't want to run wires to it.
