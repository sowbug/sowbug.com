If you want to use [Google Slides](http://www.google.com/slides/about/) to
make an [Ignite](http://igniteshow.com/)-style presentation where the 20
slides are each 15 seconds, throw this animated GIF in the corner of the
master. Want to make your own? [Check out the
repository](https://github.com/sowbug/clockgif) and customize it.

There are 20 copies of the 15-second sequence in the GIF. This is for two
reasons. First, Slides doesn't reload the GIF between transitions, so if you
had a single 15-second non-looping GIF, it would halt after the first slide.
Using a non-looping GIF lets you add some slide-to-slide animations, such as a
yellow progress bar telling you how far you are in the presentation.
