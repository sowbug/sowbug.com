I want to program a Xilinx XC9572XL and refuse to buy a $50 dongle to do so.
Keywords in my research so far: xapp058,
[XSVF](http://www.gadgetfactory.net/gadgetforum/index.php?topic=277.0), SVF,
JTAG, [arduiggler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinodoodles/). There is
an [FT232-based version](http://openschemes.com/2011/10/25/bit-bang-jtag-
programming-of-xilinx-cpld-using-ft232-homebrew-svf-player/) that seems very
close to what I want, but it's written in Visual Basic, of all things, and
probably won't work on a modern non-FTDI Arduino.

If you're reading this and do contract programming in exchange for karma,
please write it in Python to avoid cross-platform issues!
