As far as I can tell, the latest 1.1.7 BIOS update for the XPS 13 removes the
ability to charge via USB Power Delivery at 5 volts. I didn’t do a lot of
testing, but I know that when I first got the machine, it did charge from a
Nexus 6P charger plugged into the Thunderbolt/USB Type C port. Slowly, and the
BIOS griped at boot, but it did charge.

I’m pretty sure I lost the capability with the BIOS update. I’m going to try
reverting to 1.0.5, but the machine won’t do a BIOS update unless it’s plugged
in, and at the moment I don’t have a charger.

Dell, if you’re listening and I’m correct that the change was intentional,
please reconsider this regression. Some of us bought the XPS 13 in part
because of its ability to use USB Power Delivery (without qualification). And
even if the charge rate is extremely slow, 5-volt charging can be a day-saver
for someone who left a standard charger at home but happens to have a USB-C
phone charger available (like me).
