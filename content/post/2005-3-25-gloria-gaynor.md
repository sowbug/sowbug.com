Yesterday on the XM Radio station [
Chrome](http://www.xmradio.com/programming/channel_page.jsp?ch=83) I heard the
long version of Gloria Gaynor's disco anthem _I Will Survive_ for the first
time. It's quite impressive. The version you're probably used to hearing is
about three minutes long. But the long version is basically her singing the
whole song all over again. Toward the end the drummer starts doing some really
funky improvisations, like he's had an itch for a while and needs to scratch
without missing any beats.
