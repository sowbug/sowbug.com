The [Hypna Go Go](/hypnagogo) recently woke me up three times in one night.
I've [adjusted the lighting
algorithm](https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo/commit/19dad15bac9c3044ce51e20b6702617b921ee203#firmware/main.c)
to fade in gently, and hope this will help.

**Update: Progress. I had a [false awakening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_awakening) after this change, in which I took off my sleep mask and tried to shut off the HGG, but discovered the battery was getting weak. Then in real life my kids woke me up. I consider this to be progress because it was my first reaction to the lights where I didn't wake up. Unfortunately, rather than realizing I was dreaming, I did what I usually do when the lights wake me up: I take off the mask and shut off the device.**
