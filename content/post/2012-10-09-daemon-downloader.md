Sometimes I come across interesting things to download while I'm out and
about, but I can't download them (because I'm on a phone) or I'm at work
(where I'd then have to figure out how to transfer them to home). These are
things that are wasteful to sic Dropbox on.

What I really want is to have a private email address I can email URLs, and
whoever's listening on the other end will cause my home file server to
download the content (handling properly if the resource turns out to be a
torrent).

Does such a thing exist?
