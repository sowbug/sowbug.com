I've seen these crazy lucid-dreaming goggle projects for years, but recently
stumbled across a really simple one on
[Instructables](http://instructables.com/id/The-Lucid-Dream-Machine/). I
happened to have all the parts around the house, so I made one. I've since
[improved the firmware](https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo) and designed a
real circuit board that is off at Laen's. The improvements are that the
circuit board is smaller, and the firmware is lower-power and better
synchronized with a typical 8-hour-sleep REM schedule.

As noted in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/sowbug/hypnagogo), it
hasn't worked for me over three nights of testing. I have two theories.

One theory is that the lights aren't bright enough. I used some very old red
LEDs with about 140 ohms of resistance. They're completely visible to me in my
tests, but it might not be enough for my sleeping brain to notice.

The other theory is that it actually is working, but I'm not remembering any
of it when I wake up. This is a distinct possibility because I almost never
remember dreams. They say that teaching yourself to remember your dreams is
the first step in improved dream awareness. I'll work on that.

Meanwhile, here's a picture of what I built, and you can also check out the
EAGLE files and the AVR code.
