All the search results for [linux nexys2] discuss how the heck you run that
djtgtgtgjdsasdfghjkcfg Digilent tool on Linux. In other words, how do you
program the Nexys2 on Linux?

But what would it take to run Linux _**on**_ the Nexys2, or a similar medium-
sized FPGA? Can you just download an <http://opencores.org/> processor that
has a gcc toolchain for it, throw in some I/O controllers, and get the kernel
booted up? I am so new to FPGA that I can't even do a back-of-the-envelope
calculation whether a Linux-capable core, plus glue, would fit. But it would
be a fun project to find out!
