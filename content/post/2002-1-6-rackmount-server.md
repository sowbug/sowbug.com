## Motivation

  * Inexpensive: I don't want to spend more than $700.
  * Excellent performance: it's going to be mostly just a web server, rather than a compute server, so the requirements are fairly low.
  * High-quality components: all name-brand.
  * Not expandable. The odds of being able to upgrade economically are probably very small, so I'm not willing to spend extra for expandability in the future.
  * Something I'd be proud to have built (no bolt cutters, duct tape, or homemade moving parts).

## Stuff I learned while building this server

  * The Intel [D815EEA2LU](http://developer.intel.com/design/motherbd/ea2/index.htm) seems like a perfect board for a rackmount server, but it doesn't fit in a 1U case. The audio riser is too high.
  * I bought the retail version of the Celeron because I wanted a fan with it, but the fan doesn't fit in a 1U case. So that was a waste of a couple of dollars.
  * It turns out that the Celeron 1.2GHz has an "integrated heat spreader" that plays more nicely with this particular board's built-in heat sink. Oh well.
  * I didn't bother with a floppy drive. I will probably regret it.
  * [Pricewatch](http://pricewatch.com) is pretty cool, but it doesn't list every company in the world, so it still pays to do a search or two on [Google](http://google.com).
  * There are a couple of barebones 1U servers out there by well-known manufacturers, such as the Intel ISP1100 ([here](http://microx-press.com/templates/micro/product.asp?sid=4560ECB0724A47C69BBFBCDE7615A3FD&prodid=MBRIN409) is one for sale) and the [Supermicro 5010E](http://supermicro.com/PRODUCT/SUPERServer/SUPER%20SERVER%205010E%20Server.htm), but they're just plain more expensive than building it yourself. I looked at the 5010E at [Fry's Electronics ](http://frys.com)and it didn't give me an impression of being high quality -- the stickers were put on crooked and it looked like it was all plastic.
