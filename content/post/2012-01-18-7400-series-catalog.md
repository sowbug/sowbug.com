Does such a thing exist but simplified for today's ADHD youth like me? Here's
what I want:

  * Name ('00)
  * Description (quad 2-input NAND gate)
  * A plain English paragraph describing why you'd want this chip
  * Pinout with legend for the abbreviations
  * Maybe a cool circuit or clever hack using the chip

There's
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits),
of course, but it doesn't contain all the information in a condensed and
complete format, like a PDF that could be printed and kept on a workbench.
While there are PDF catalogs on various sites I've found, they're produced by
people trying to sell chips, which unfortunately means they're full of
marketing speak and newer circuits that I wouldn't be able to buy in
quantities &lt; 100,000 anyway.

Totally dorky, but I'd love trading cards for the 7400 series. _I'll trade you
my 12-stage binary ripple counter for your quad 2-input XOR gate!_
