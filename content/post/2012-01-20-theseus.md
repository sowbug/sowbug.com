In the middle of a great email exchange with [Sean
Riddle](http://seanriddle.com/) (the all-time PageRank leader for Williams
hardware and software), and the [Ship of
Theseus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) came up. It's an old
philosophical puzzle where a ship sails around the world, in the process
having broken and worn-out parts replaced as needed. By the time it arrives
back in its home port, every part has been replaced. _Question: is it still
the same ship?_

Now there's a project code name! So here's the proposal: **8821** is project
to understand how a 6809 works in the year 2012. **Theseus** is the project to
resurrect an old Joust while keeping its identity as a Joust. File your
objections with the Review Board within five business days.

**Update 2/1/2012: This name didn't stick. It sounds too much like "thesis," and I avoided grad school precisely so I'd never have to work on one of those.**
