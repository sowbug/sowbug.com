title = "Hi Mike, This is really cool (JTAG Whisperer). I am really interested in trying this out with a Teensy 2, wwwpjrccom. I have a couple on hand right now. Those will run \"serial\" at about 1.1 MByte/sec. Jack also sent me a C/Wing board... so I can try programming it. Question: the Python side of things. What do I need to do to set up Python, where is your code, etc. I have never done Python. I do like communicationg with Arduino thru Microsoft's free C# Express. That might be another option..."

Python's at [www.python.org](http://www.python.org). The blog links to the
GitHub project, and it's the top hit on Google for "jtag whisperer." If you
have trouble running it, let me know. I'm not going to be the best authority
on setting up Python, but there are (probably) a zillion howtos out there.
Good luck and let me know how it goes!
