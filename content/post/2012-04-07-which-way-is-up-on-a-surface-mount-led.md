To remember which way the cathode (negative) end is on a surface-mount LED,
look at the green thing on the underside. It's a tree, sticking into the
ground. It looks like a ground symbol on a schematic. The ground end is
ground. There you go.

For some reason, SMD/SMT LEDs sometimes have a green stripe on the top.
Sometimes it's on the anode side, sometimes it's on the cathode. As far as I
can tell, it's random.
