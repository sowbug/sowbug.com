 [Simple
Virtual Machine](http://syprog.blogspot.com/2011/12/simple-virtual-
machine.html)  

Summary: here's how to design a computing machine and tools to build programs
for it. Oh, and here are the actual machine and tools, too.

I love articles like this because they're a reminder of how simple computers
are. They move electrons from one place to another in a predictable fashion.
Sure, any hardware or software out in the real world is many times more
complex than the little virtual machine in this article, but it's reassuring
from time to time to clear away the outer layers of computing and confirm that
it's quite simple inside.
