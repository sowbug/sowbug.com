[WebLight](https://github.com/sowbug/weblight/) is a
[WebUSB](https://reillyeon.github.io/webusb/) blinky light device. You plug it
in to a computer running a browser that supports the WebUSB standard
(currently only recent Chrome builds that have certain chrome:flags enabled),
and without requiring any driver installation, it just works. Each LED module
is RGB and individually controllable.

The first prototypes aren’t much to look at. I intend the final version to use
micro-USB and fit comfortably in a plastic LED-candle holder. It needs to be
plastic to make it possible to cut a slot for the USB cable.

When it’s done, it should make a good status light for broken builds or stock-
price changes, and it should look reasonably nice on a desk at work.

The circuit design was simple. I mostly copied the schematic from the
[Adafruit Trinket](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-
trinket/introduction). I originally used the WS2812B LED module, but recently
replaced it with the APA102C, which works better with [bitbanged
USB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) on a small microcontroller.

The device should cost about $2.50 to manufacture in quantity. It would be
cool if [AliExpress](http://www.aliexpress.com/) manufacturers started
building it and selling it dirt-cheap; then everyone who wanted one would have
a status light on their desk.
