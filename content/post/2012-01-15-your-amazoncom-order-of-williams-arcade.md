I bought an old CD-ROM of _[Williams Arcade Classics](http://www.amazon.com
/Williams-Arcade-Classics-PC/dp/B0007SN0RU)_, which is a collection of ROM
images and an emulator that runs on a PC. This means little more than that
I'll be legal to possess copies of the game ROMs (besides Joust, which I
already own). Sean Riddle has already written
[code](http://seanriddle.com/uncomp.c) to extract the ROMs from the PC
version, but to be honest, I think it's easier to type "mame roms" into a
search engine and see where that leads me.
