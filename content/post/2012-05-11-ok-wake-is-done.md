I ran through a full sequence Tuesday night and was happy with what I saw. So
I've tagged the project [FIRMWARE_WORKING_1_0_0](https://github.com/sowbug/ok-
wake/zipball/FIRMWARE_WORKING_1_0_0), and after a morning or two to confirm
that the actual devices are working, I'll deliver one to my friend.

It's fun to finish projects. The [Hypna Go Go](/hypnagogo) is a practical
device that I use almost daily, and now OK Wake has the potential to help a
friend and his family manage their morning routine. I feel a sense of
accomplishment.

Next tasks: build an [RPio](/rpio) (the boards arrived over the weekend,
though still no Raspberry Pi on the horizon). And do one more hardware
revision of the [AVR Programmer](/isp). I also have a couple more quick
projects in mind.
