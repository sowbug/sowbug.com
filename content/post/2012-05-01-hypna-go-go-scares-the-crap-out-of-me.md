A couple nights ago I had my first [Hypna Go Go](/post/20906913903/the-hypna-
go-go)-influenced dream. I don't remember what had been happening in the
dream, but suddenly a bright drag-race-Christmas-tree-style pole of lights
appeared right in front of me. I realized that this was my signal that I was
dreaming. Unfortunately, I couldn't shake my dream-world concern _why_ the big
red lights were flashing; was it an ambulance? Was it a traffic jam or an
accident? Were my family members hurt? The next couple moments of the dream
were vague and unpleasant, and I woke up.

I'm not going to change anything with the device for now. Yes, the lights are
probably a little too bright, but having replayed the light-pole event in my
mind several times while awake, I believe I can train myself so that next time
it won't be a distressing experience.

Incidentally, I'm getting pretty good at dream recall. I've written down about
ten dreams, and have been aware that I've forgotten nearly as many more. This
is much better than a few weeks ago, when it seemed that I had no dreams at
all. And lately I've been having a sense of general well-being about the
world, which I would expect given that my dreams are often about seeing old
friends and being in interesting places. Or maybe it's because it's Spring in
my part of the world.
