I got the video assembly out of storage, and it's dead. I know that CRTs use
high voltages, and I'm allergic to kryptonite, so I won't be messing around
with that thing. No jousting today. I'm also concerned that the sound board
isn't doing anything, though it's getting power. I went through the
diagnostics in the [Joust owner's
manual](http://www.robotron-2084.co.uk/manualsjoust.html), and made it through
the flowchart to "yep, your machine is busted" in all cases. It's a safe
assumption there are multiple problems with this 30-year-old machine, aside
from the ones I've fixed so far.

After a break for dinner, I got to thinking. The video output from the CPU
board is R, G, B, HSync, and VSync. That sure looks a lot like VGA. Is VGA the
same scheme? Do VGA monitors tolerate only certain sync frequencies? Would it…
just work?
