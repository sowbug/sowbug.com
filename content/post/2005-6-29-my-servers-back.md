As all three of you noticed, my server died last Wednesday. It's a [User Mode
Linux](http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/) server, and my trusty nightly
rsync backup script sorta stopped working back in November 2004, so when the
server disappeared, yeah, I lost some data.

Fortunately, November 2004 was just before my
[son](http://emilytsao.aboutmybaby.com/) was born, so blog entries dropped off
dramatically around then, and there wasn't a lot to reconstruct. I got help
from several sources:

  * Bloglines caches blogs in a format that's pretty faithful to the original. I was able to save their Javascript page, fiddle with it a little, then view the result in my browser. Then I copied the HTML into an HTML editor, and that was close enough to the original content.
  * For metadata like timestamps, I asked around and luckily a few friends had RSS and Atom feeds left over on their computers. It helps to know people working at a [company](http://www.qurb.com/) developing blog software. :) Thanks, Antony and Erik!
  * [Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/)'s web history helped with some HTML recovery.

I was able to get all but about five late-2004 items perfectly recovered.
Apologies in advance when those show up, incorrectly, as "updated" in your
aggregator.

Oh, and by the way, I'm now hosted at [Linode](http://www.linode.com/). No
comment yet on their reliability, but their configuration pages are quite
nice. I look forward to the commercialization of
[Xen](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/); I suspect you get more
bang for the buck than UML.

Update: For some reason my registrar decided to switch my domain to their
parked host webserver, so anyone visiting sees a "coming soon!" page instead
of mine. I believe I fixed the problem two hours ago, but their nameservers
are still serving the incorrect address. What good is a 60-minute TTL if you
can't get your changes published more quickly than that?
