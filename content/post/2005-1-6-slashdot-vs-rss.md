For nearly seven years, Slashdot has been my primary source for geek news.
Nearly everything I've read there was novel. But lately I've noticed that I
rarely see anything on Slashdot that another RSS feed didn't already mention.
Slashdot will continue to have some of the best commentary on geek topics, so
of course I'll still read it, but currently RSS wins for timeliness.
