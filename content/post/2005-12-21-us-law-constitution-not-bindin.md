got it right. If you're OK with George Bush spying on Americans because the
war on terror gives him the power to ignore the law and the U.S. Constitution,
then you had better be especially OK with President Michael Moore spying on
you, too. (**_President Michael Moore?!?!_** Sure, that sounds silly. But in
1950, would you have bet on Ronald Reagan for President? In 1985, would you
have bet on Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor of California? How about Cher's
husband in 1977 as a U.S. Congressman?)

The war on terror ain't ending. At least, I'm not planning on attending the
victory party when they throw one, not unless security is REALLY tight. So
when Michael Moore is President, the war on terror will still be in effect,
and President Moore will cite President Bush as precedent for his continuing
power to ignore the law, the Constitution, the Congress, and the U.S. Supreme
Court, as long as he thinks he's making our country safer from our
government's enemies.

This isn't about politics. It's not about whether you support President Bush.
It's about whether you believe the law and the U.S. Constitution should apply
to every American, including the American government.
