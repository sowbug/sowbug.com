[RPio: A Raspberry Pi Breakout Board](https://github.com/sowbug/rpio)  

This weekend I whipped up a breakout board for the [Raspberry
Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). The [RPio](https://github.com/sowbug/rpio)
bidirectionally level-shifts the GPIO pins between their 3.3-volt level and a
more hobbyist-friendly 5 volts. It also provides more 3.3-volt power than the
meager 50mA provided from the RPi's expansion header. My own Raspberry Pi
order isn't due to be fulfilled until the late Spring, so I'm in no great big
hurry to build my own. But if you're interested in getting one, please let me
know.
