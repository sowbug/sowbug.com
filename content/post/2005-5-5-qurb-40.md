Congratulations to my friends and former coworkers at [
Qurb](http://www.qurb.com/), who just released their [ 4.0
beta](http://www.qurb.com/beta). As I understand it, 4.0's principal new
feature is an RSS/Atom aggregator. "Feed reader" is a less techy term for the
same thing, but it's less likely to be properly indexed by search engines ;).

It seems like just last week that 3.0 went final. Qurb is really picking up
steam!
