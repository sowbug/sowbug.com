> The concept of using software to design hardware that runs software will
surely cause you endless hours of contemplation.

I wasn't prepared for the six-gig behemoth that is the Xilinx ISE, so it's
taken me longer than expected to get anything resembling Hello World going in
that environment. By comparison, the Arduino IDE is pretty incredible. There's
a lot to be said for a relatively small download and easy installation process
that leads to a blinking LED in maybe five minutes. I know Xilinx and Arduino
are going for entirely different audiences, but ease of installation these
days ought to be a universal feature.

Meanwhile, I'm reading _[The Low-Carb VHDL
Tutorial](http://teal.gmu.edu/courses/ECE545/viewgraphs_F04/loCarb_VHDL_small.pdf)_
by Bryan Mealy. I'm not confused… yet.

Why VHDL and not Verilog? Two reasons: first, all the
[OpenCores](http://opencores.org/) processors I've looked at are written in
VHDL, so even if I were a Verilog master I'd have to learn at least to read
VHDL. Second, I've been told that Verilog is closer to C and thus easier to
learn for C programmers. I'm seeking to bend my brain as much as possible
without breaking it, so I'll choose the _harder_ language to learn.
