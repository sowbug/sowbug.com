In _ [ Gonzales v.
Raich](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=03-1454)_,
six Supreme Court justices acted against the express will of the people in
eight states.* Will Bill Frist now include those justices in his rants against
"activist judges"?

*Of the ten states with laws permitting use of medical marijuana, eight enacted their laws as the result of direct popular election.
