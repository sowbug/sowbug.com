Dennis made some routing improvements after I sent the board to Laen, and I
decided to switch to the '244 rather than '241 (not checked in yet). But the
schematic hasn't changed, so the PCBs we get back should be good enough to
validate the design, so we won't have this one manufactured until 1_0_0_FINAL
comes back.

I've created a partial [shopping cart at
Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=76637a6c60).
It's missing the [right-angle header](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products
/PPTC032LJBN-RC/S5517-ND/775975) and miscellaneous other headers that we
intend to be optionally soldered by the end user. It also has a couple
alternative versions of parts; for example, we might want to switch to a
stronger micro-USB socket with positioning tabs that fit into PCB holes,
because this is the kind of device that will be frequently plugged and
unplugged.

The BOM is looking to be about $7.50 exclusive of the PCB, in single-unit
quantities.
