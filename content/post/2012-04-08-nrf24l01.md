I wonder why more makers don't use the
[nRF24L01+](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/2.4GHz-RF/nRF24L01P) for
wireless design. It's almost free, it's super-low power, it's easy to use with
SPI, it's 5-volt tolerant, it's plenty fast for 8-bit applications, and it
just plain works. It might be because it's available only in QFN, which looks
scary.
