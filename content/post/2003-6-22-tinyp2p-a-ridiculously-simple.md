I wrote this to test asynchronous socket I/O notifications on Windows. It
turned out to be a nice self-contained project, so here it is, with source.
MIT license. Requires Visual Studio .NET to build. It should be easy to figure
out how to build it on earlier versions of Visual Studio.  
  
Have fun. [tinyp2p.zip](assets/zip/tinyp2p.zip)
