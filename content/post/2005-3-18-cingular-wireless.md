AT&amp;T; Wireless customers, one of whom is me, were switched over to
Cingular a few months ago following the merger. My new carrier has a trick to
either get people to pay their bills earlier, or charge them hard-to-dispute
penalties for unintentionally paying a few days late.

Nowhere on the bill does it give a date when the bill is due. Instead, in the
"Date Due" field it says "UPON RECEIPT." In the itemized portion of the bill
it says a "late fee may be applied for amounts unpaid 22 days after the date
the invoice was mailed." But there's no indication when the invoice was
mailed. There is no postmark. There is a "Date of Invoice," but that could be
before or after the mailing date -- indeed, on my latest bill the itemized
charges stopped three days before the date of invoice, so they could very well
have mailed it with a post-dated invoice.

Since it's impossible to tell with certainty when this 22-day period begins or
ends, most people will simply pay the bill right away rather than risk being
late. And if they are charged a late fee, it'll be hard to determine whether
it was justified.

Evil, inconvenient, and lame.

I hear some readers saying that the due date is "right away," and that I have
no right to demand a grace period. The most concise answer I can come up with
to that position is "**WRONG**." A slightly less pithy response is that this
is a contract, and both parties should be able to know the exact terms of the
contract.
