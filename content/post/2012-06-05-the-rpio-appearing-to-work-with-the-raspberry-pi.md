The [RPio](http://www.sowbug.com/rpio), appearing to work with the Raspberry
Pi that arrived tonight. I haven't soldered headers on the RPio (I'm still in
disbelief that the RPi comes with male headers), so I'm establishing the
connections with friction; that's why the tweezer handle is holding it in
place.
